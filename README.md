# Agentic AI & LangGraph Learning Journey

*A structured progression through modern agent systems, based on the CampusX LangGraph course.*

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository captures my step-by-step learning process as I explore **Agentic AI**, **LangGraph**, and the architecture behind modern AI systems. The goal isn’t just to follow tutorials, but to understand how real, production-grade agents are built — from simple workflows to stateful, event-driven systems.

---

## ✅ Learning Roadmap

This repo follows the progression of the course:

### **Lecture 1 – Introduction to Generative AI vs Agentic AI**

* Understanding why static prompt → response systems aren’t enough
* The role of goals, tools, memory, and decision-making
* Real-world scenarios where agents outperform simple LLMs

### **Lecture 2 – What is Agentic AI?**

* Agents as systems with autonomy and action paths
* Memory, tools, goals, and feedback loops
* How LangGraph structures agent behavior

### **Lecture 3 – Workflows vs Agents**

* Workflows = predefined paths
* Agents = dynamic decisions based on state + goals
* Limitations of LangChain
* Event-driven design, state objects, fault tolerance
* Retry, recovery, checkpointing
* Subgraphs and modular agent design

### **Lecture 4 – LangGraph Core Concepts**

* Nodes, edges, and graph execution
* StateGraph vs MessageGraph
* How state is passed and mutated
* Checkpointing and resumability
* Human-in-the-loop support
* Building the mental model of a graph-based agent

*(Lectures 5+ will be added as I progress.)*

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Agentic AI is becoming central to building real-world apps like:

* automation engines
* research assistants
* voice agents
* tool-using systems
* multi-agent workflows

Understanding these architectural patterns makes it easier to build systems that are:
✅ reliable
✅ stateful
✅ fault-tolerant
✅ extendable
✅ production-ready
